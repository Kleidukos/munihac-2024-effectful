# The need for side-effect tracking

## Determinism, Referential transparency

* > Determinism: The output of an expression stays the same if the input is the same
* > Referential transparency: You can replace a call to a function with its result in a safe and predictible manner

:::notes
Interactions with the outside world in non-reproducible ways is the burden of many programmers.
I want to clarify some notions here that make life much, much easier.
:::

---

# The need for side-effect tracking

## No side effects

* No alteration of the outside world in ways that matter to us
  * Missile strike? No!
  * Register allocation? Fairly essential.

::: notes
Meanwhile in an Eternal War alternate reality based on launching missiles: we do not allocate registers willy-nilly!
:::

# The need for side-effect tracking

## Side effects are arbitrary

> A function without any effect is called total and corresponds to mathematically total functions ‚Äì a good place to be.
> Then we have effects for partial functions that can raise exceptions (exn), and potentially non-terminating functions as div (divergent).
> **The combination of exn and div is called pure as that corresponds to Haskell's notion of purity.**

‚Äì "The Koka Programming Language"

:::notes
Now, does that mean that IO is complete bullshit? No! We needed an analytical framework to understand and anticipate the results of programs, and IO was the option that was retained **at the time**

# The need for side-effect tracking

## Enforcing sequentiality of computations

### When you're a pure lambda calculus girl living in a pure lambda calculus world, life in plastic _is_ indeed fantastic!

:::notes
You can do a lot with the generated code, like re-organise it, inline it,
anticipate what it will do and replace function calls.
Inlining becomes easier as well, when you know for a fact that.
:::

---

# The need for side-effect tracking

## Enforcing sequentiality of computations

### But how about computations that depend on each-other?

::: notes
However you can't do much when it comes to interacting with the outside world, and at the level of code generation, there are things that are absolutely forbidden, like re-organising the order of computations that depend on each-other and that produce side-effects.

# Interlude: Anatomy of a type signature

```haskell
fun :: a
```

```haskell
       ‚ùó
      ‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê
fun :: IO a
```

``` haskell
            ‚ùó
      ‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê
fun :: (Constraint a) => IO a
```

---

# Semantic side-effect tracking

## These functions could be doing anything

```haskell
trace :: Text -> IO a -> IO a

fetchFromCache :: Int -> IO (Maybe Result)

log :: Text -> IO ()

fetchFromDB :: Int -> IO (Maybe Result)

throwError :: ServerError -> IO ()
```

::: notes
The signification of `IO` is, fundamentally: I give up.
We saw earlier that Haskell admits runtime exceptions as part of its model for purity (think about `undefined` or `error`).
:::

---

# Semantic side-effect tracking

<div class="big-3 horizontally-centered">
Semantic Opacity
</div>

```haskell
myComputation :: Int -> IO Result
myComputation number = trace "myComputation" $ do
  mCacheResult <- fetchFromCache number
  case mCacheResult of
    Just cacheResult -> do
      log "Found result from cache"
      pure cacheResult
    Nothing -> do
      log "No result in cache"
      mDatabaseResult <- fetchFromDB number
      case mDatabaseResult of
        Nothing -> do
          log "No result in database"
          throwError notFound
        Just dbResult -> do
          log "Found result from database"
          pure dbResult
```

::: notes
Putting every type of outside interaction into the 'IO' box is Semantic Opacity:
This leads us into a mental framework of pure versus impure, good versus evil, safe versus unsafe,
which is not only wrong but also steers us in the wrong direction for thinking about systems.

From an architectural point of view we need to be able to know what are the interactions
of our systems.

```haskell
trace :: (Trace :> es) => Text -> Eff es a -> Eff es a

fetchFromCache :: (Cache :> es) => Int -> Eff es (Maybe Result)

log :: (Log :> es) => Text -> Eff es ()

fetchFromDB :: (DB :> es) => Int -> Eff es (Maybe Result)

throwError :: (Error ServerError :> es) => ServerError -> Eff es ()
```

```haskell
-- Make this type signature still polymorphic
myComputation
  :: (Trace :> es, Log :> es, Cache :> es, DB :> es, Error ServerError :> es)
  => Int
  -> Eff es Result
```

<div class="horizontally-centered big-3">
 üéâ üéâ üéâ
</div>

::: notes
We were blindly using IO to say "all bets are off", and now we are listing,
with precision, well-understood effects that denote interactions with various outside systems.

Lo and behold: suddenly `myComputation` makes a lot more sense!

Notice that we are using the syntax for constraints here. With the help of the compiler,
redundant constraints are signalled, and can tell you if you have mistakenly removed an
interaction with an outside system, because this interaction is labeled at the types level.

## Historically: Monad Transformers

* Newtypes around values with a custom `Monad` instance

---

### Monad Transformers Stacks

```haskell
newtype ReaderT r m a
ask :: Monad m => ReaderT r m r
```

* `r`: The static environment that we pass along
* `m`: The monad on which the transformer is stacked
* `a`: The return value of the computation

#### Stack 'Em Up! üòé


```haskell
ReaderT Int IO String
```

* Top monad: `Reader`
  * Its environment: `Int`
* Base monad:  `IO`
* Return value: `String`

---

import Control.Monad.Trans.Class

  lift $ putStrLn "I access IO!"
  number <- ask
  pure $ show number
```

---

### Monad Transformer Babel Towers

What the hell am I supposed to do with this‚Ä¶

```haskell
action2 :: ReaderT Int (StateT Env (WriterT [Int] IO)) String
action2 = do
  liftIO $ putStrLn "I have to use a shortcut for IO"
  lift $ lift $ tell [42] -- ü™ñ‚õèü™®
  pure $ "‚Ä¶ and all I got was this lousy t-shirt."
```

```haskell
action2 :: ReaderT Int (StateT Env (WriterT [Int] IO)) String
action2 = do
  liftIO $ putStrLn "I have to use a shortcut for IO"
  lift $ lift $ tell [42] -- ü™ñ‚õèü™®
  pure $ "‚Ä¶ and all I got was this lousy t-shirt."
```

#### This is something I found at work
(_Names have been changed to protect the innocent_)

```haskell
ReaderT AuthEnv (
  RedisReaderT Persistent (
    CryptoRNGT (
      DBT (
        LogT (
          TraceT IO)))))
```
---

### In Conclusion

* Historical solution for making type signatures more declarative
* Fixed order of effects
* The same effects are always available all the time

---

### Monad Transformer Library (`mtl`)

```haskell
class Monad m => MonadReader r m | m -> r where
  ask :: m r
```

* `r`: The static environment that we pass along
* `m`: The monad that we specify to have `Reader` capabilities
* No `a` mentioned, it's the one from your type signature

#### Effects live as Constraints.
As a consequence:

 * No rigid order of effects **all the time**
 * Omission of unneeded effects
 * GHC tells us about unused effects

---

### Monad Transformer Library (`mtl`)

#### Constraints in Action

```haskell
( Reader AuthEnv m
, RedisReader PersisTent m
, CryptoRNG m
, DB m
, Log m
, Trace m
) => m Handler
```

A stack with six transformers could mean six appearances of `(>>=)` between each monadic action,
no matter if you use them all as constraints.

Specialisation is thus mandatory for GHC to produce decent code!

---

### Liftin'? I barely know 'im!

No need for lifting in the user code.

```Haskell
instance MonadReader r m => MonadReader r (StateT s m) where
  ask = lift ask
```

---

### Liftin'? I barely know 'im!

However it has to happen somewhere.

```haskell
instance MonadReader r m => MonadReader r (ExceptT e m)
  ask = lift ask

instance MonadReader r m => MonadReader r (IdentityT m)
  ask = lift ask

instance MonadReader r m => MonadReader r (MaybeT m)
  ask = lift ask

instance MonadReader r m => MonadReader r (Lazy.StateT s m)
  ask = lift ask

instance MonadReader r m => MonadReader r (Strict.StateT s m)
  ask = lift ask

instance (Monoid w, MonadReader r m) => MonadReader r (CPS.WriterT w m)
  ask = lift ask

instance (Monoid w, MonadReader r m) => MonadReader r (Lazy.WriterT w m)
  ask = lift ask

instance (Monoid w, MonadReader r m) => MonadReader r (Strict.WriterT w m)
  ask = lift ask
```

---

### In Conclusion

* Based on `transformers`
* Usage of constraints give more flexibility
* Boilerplate has to be managed with compiler extensions

---

## Free Monads

Free Monads give any Functor a monadic structure, much like `Semigroup` gives any `Type` a concatenable structure

```haskell
data Free f a
  = Pure a
  | Free (f (Free f a))
```

The main appeal of Free monads is that since you reify your computation **as** a data structure, you can inspect it.

---

## Free Monads

### Time to pay up

#### Inspection is **not** Static Analysis

* Monadic actions mean that computations depend on each-other
* You have to generate values for each action because the next one depends on it

#### Performance trade-offs

Two kinds of Free Monads

* The na√Øve ones that run in quadratic time, and have linear inspection
* The co-density ones that run in linear time, but have quadratic inspection

---

## Free Monads

### Upsold on freedom

Fre**er** Monads are supposed to solve problems of Free Monads, but remain exotic.

---

## Free Monads

### Upsold on freedom

Fre**er** Monads are supposed to solve problems of Free Monads, but remain exotic.

### You actually run two programs

Free Monads build a program on top of your program, to generate the code that will be executed.

---

## Free Monads

Main libraries:

* `freer-simple`
  * Does not allow higher-order effects
* `polysemy`
  * Unconditionally slow and relies on a lot of aggressive optimisations

### In Conclusion

* Two operations: "run" and "inspect", and you need to tailor your implementation for one of these
* Program is slow to run in any case

# Now Introducing: Effectful

:::jumbogroup
<img src="./assets/img/effectful-logo.png" height=300>

# Now Introducing: Effectful

> Created by Andrzej Rybczak in 2021

## Integrations with the Haskell ecosystem
  * Drop-in solution in ü´µ your codebase
  * Integrations with `unliftio` and `exceptions`
  * Integration with third-party MTL and transformers

:::notes
Effectful stems from the double need of replacing stacks of a dozen transformers in industrial
code bases. For this, it needs very good integration with libraries like `unliftio`, `exceptions`, because it is made to be dropped into in an ecosystem of libraries.
:::

---

# Now Introducing: Effectful

## Reliable Foundation
  * To hell with counter-intuitive interactions!
  * No more state loss on exceptions
  * IO and exceptions are supported out-of-the-box

::: notes
However, it does not inherit types from the `transformers` library.
For the sake of correctness, Effectful re-implemented the State, Writer, and Except transformers. While ReaderT does not have any surprising behaviour,
the ways StateT and ExceptT interact together can be pretty counter-intuitive! Especially, dropping state updates is not cool, and the fact that
ExceptT does not raise a runtime exception means that resources are not freed. It's very easy to inadvertently trigger a space leak.

That's why many people decide to stay on `ReaderT IO`.

:::

---

# Now Introducing: Effectful

## Performant
  * Low-level performance
  * Unlike Free Monads, no "program tree" is built at run-time
    * Handlers are called in-place, thanks to _evidence-passing_.
  * Unlike MTL, you only pay for what you use

::: notes
Effectful makes use of efficient data structures, like `SmallMutableArray`, Strict `IORef` and `MVar` to avoid space leaks.

As such, the performance need not to be just decent but very good. It makes use of IORefs, and low-level Haskell constructs like mutable arrays.
:::

---

# Now Introducing: Effectful

## Interactions with transformers / mtl
  * `Eff` provides `MonadMask` and `MonadUnliftIO`
  * Interfacing with existing libraries is well-supported **and** documented

---

# Now Introducing: Effectful

## Tradeoffs
  * No *real* Non-Determinism
  * No Coroutines
  * IO, `MonadUnliftIO`, capabilities are privileged compared to suspending and resuming computation

---

# Now Introducing: Effectful

## Ergonomics

From:

```haskell
webHandler
  :: ( MonadBaseControl IO m , MonadCatch , MonadDB m , MonadFileStorage m
     , MonadLog m , MonadMask m , MonadRandom m , MonadThrow
     , MonadTime m , MonadTrace m)
```

to

```haskell
webHandler
  :: ( FileStorage :> es
     , RNG :> es
     , Log :> es
     , Time :> es
     , Trace :> es
     , DB :> es
     , IOE :> es)
```

::: notes
Offering good ergonomics to replace your bare ReaderT or your MTL constraints.

The Eff monad has instances for MonadThrow, MonadCatch, MonadMask, and `MonadBaseControl IO`, so you don't have to specify them manually.
:::

---

# Implementing Effects

---

## Static Reader

```haskell
data Reader r :: Effect

type instance DispatchOf (Reader r) = Static NoSideEffects
newtype instance StaticRep (Reader r) = Reader r
```

```haskell
runReader
  :: r -- ^ The initial environment.
  -> Eff (Reader r : es) a
  -> Eff es a
runReader action = evalStaticRep (Reader action)

ask :: Reader r :> es => Eff es r
ask = do
  Reader r <- getStaticRep
  pure r
```

---

## Dynamic Reader

```haskell
data Reader r :: Effect where
  Ask   :: Reader r m r

type instance DispatchOf (Reader r) = Dynamic

```

```haskell
ask :: (Reader r :> es) => Eff es r
ask = send Ask
```

---

## Existing Effect from transformers/mtl

---

### `monad-time`

```haskell
-- From `monad-time`
class Monad m => MonadTime m where
  currentTime :: m UTCTime

instance MonadTime IO where
  currentTime = getCurrentTime

-- | Generic, overlapping instance.
instance {-# OVERLAPPABLE #-} (
    MonadTime m
  , MonadTrans t
  , Monad (t m)
  ) => MonadTime (t m) where
    currentTime = lift currentTime
```

---

### `monad-time-effectful`

```haskell
-- Our effect
data Time :: Effect where
  CurrentTime :: Time m UTCTime

type instance DispatchOf Time = Dynamic

-- Canonical orphan instance
instance Time :> es => MonadTime (Eff es) where
  currentTime = send CurrentTime
```

```haskell
-- IO interpretation
runTime :: IOE :> es => Eff (Time : es) a -> Eff es a
runTime = interpret $ \_ -> \case
  CurrentTime -> liftIO getCurrentTime

-- Frozen interpretation
runFrozenTime :: IOE :> es => UTCTime -> Eff (Time : es) a -> Eff es a
runFrozenTime time = interpret $ \_ -> \case
  CurrentTime -> pure time
```

---

# Failure mode

## Errors that do not punish the user

The library understand how it is being mis-used

### Transformers

```haskell
Main.hs:34:12: error:
    ‚Ä¢ Couldn't match type: StateT Env (WriterT [Int] IO)
                     with: WriterT a0 IO
      Expected: ReaderT Int (StateT Env (WriterT [Int] IO)) String
                -> Int -> WriterT a0 IO String
        Actual: ReaderT Int (StateT Env (WriterT [Int] IO)) String
                -> Int -> StateT Env (WriterT [Int] IO) String
```

### Effectful

```haskell
Main.hs:14:13: error:
    ‚Ä¢ There is no handler for 'State Int' in the context
```

---

## Errors that do not punish the user

you get actionable advice

```haskell
If you want to use the unlifting function to run Eff computations in multiple threads,
  have a look at UnliftStrategy (ConcUnlift).
CallStack (from HasCallStack):
  error, called at src/Effectful/Internal/Unlift.hs:105:12
  seqUnlift, called at src/Effectful/Internal/Monad.hs:230:20
  seqUnliftIO, called at src/Effectful/Internal/Monad.hs:204:40
  withEffToIO, called at src/Effectful/Internal/Monad.hs:373:40
Test suite: FAIL
```

::: notes
I am directed to entities that I can look up on Hoogle!

# Conclusion

* To know about the interactions of your program with the outside world, pick an effect system
* For application development, integration is primordial
* If you want an upgrade from the `ReaderT IO` pattern, `Effectful` is for you
